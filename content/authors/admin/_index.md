I am currently a graduate student in the school of Information Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC), supervised by Prof.Tianzhu Zhang. Prior to that, I recived B.E.(Hons) degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST) in 2023. My research interests include 3D computer vision, robotics and computer graphics.

The previous summer, I was fortunate enough to work as an algorithm intern at the Insta360 Research Department, where I mostly made contributions to the lightweight single object tracking algorithm with several nice fellows.
